              In over 300 villages in Tamil Nadu, the Mahabharata is celebrated as a festival. The festival can be celebrated for a duration varying between 20 days to 120 days. What is striking is that the recounting of a fratricidal war in which millions of lives were lost becomes in these villages, a vehicle for promoting ‘Samarasam’ or Peace amongst the participating communities.

            </p>
            <p>The Epic is performed as village rituals, narrated/sung as a story and enacted right through the night in a traditional theatre form called the Koothu. Each days performance can stretch up to 20 hours, and for the entire duration of the festival everything in this festival, from the village rituals, to the storytelling sessions to the theatrical enactments is finally ‘theatre’ prompting Na Mutthuswamy, an eminent modern theatre playwright and director to call these festivals ‘Total Theatre’
            </p>
              <p>Though there is a designated theatre space in the villages, every space in the village becomes the performance space at one point or the other giving its village audience an immersive experience of the Epic.</p>
              <p>Annually, in these villages the Mahabharata is relived by entire village communities and the festivals culminate with the crowning of Dharmaraja, or Yudhisthira as he is known in these traditions, celebrating the re-establishment of Dharma on earth.
              </p>
              <p>Once there seems to have been state sponsorship for these festivals, but currently each family in the village contributes money for this festival making it probably one of the oldest theatre festivals in the world.</p>
              <p>
                The description and documentation of this elaborate festivals will be presented as a short introductory course spread over 6 days. The course will deal with the Mahabharata traditions of Tamil Nadu, it’s history, the sociology of the villages and finally the Koothu form which is the most striking part of these festivals.
